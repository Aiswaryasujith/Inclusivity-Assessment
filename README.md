# Inclusivity-Assessment

Part 1: Data Interpretation Task
Dataset: A hypothetical dataset representing a survey from a marginalized community, focusing on access to education and employment. The dataset includes variables like age, gender, education level, employment status, income, and perceived barriers to education and employment.

Task: Analyze the dataset to identify key trends and disparities in education and employment within the community.

Data Visualization Task
Dataset: Use the same dataset as above.

Task: Create a visualization that highlights the most significant finding from your analysis. The visualization should be understandable to a non-technical audience.

Data Cleaning and Management Task:
Dataset: A smaller subset of the main dataset, intentionally including inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
Task: Clean the dataset, making it suitable for analysis. Document the steps taken and the rationale behind them.
Part 2: Mission Alignment and Problem-Solving

Scenario Analysis:
Scenario: Imagine that the survey data shows a significant disparity in employment rates between genders in the community.

Task: Propose a data-driven approach to investigate and address this disparity. Discuss the additional data you might need and how you would analyze it.
Ethical Considerations: Discuss the ethical considerations you must keep in mind while handling and analyzing data from marginalized communities, especially when the data includes sensitive information.
